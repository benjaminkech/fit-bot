# FIT BOT

FIT BOT is a helper to inform me when a fully booked course at my local gym has a spot available. If the registration for the gym session is not open yet, FIT BOT tells me when the registration begins.

As soon as a spot in the gym course is available, I receive a message on my phone. With this handy tool, I can hopefully save myself a place in my favorite sessions more frequently.
